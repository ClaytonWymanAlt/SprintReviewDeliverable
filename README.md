How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- User Stories assist with implementing user needs by making them into a set of requirements that can be utilized by the developers. By turning user needs into requirements with listed priorities, this helps the developers create a system of work for implementing user needs in the most sensible order.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- The agile processes I see as most important going forward are User Stories and Test Cases, when applicable. These two processes make developing easier by setting forward requirements far more clearly than a usually list of requirements as presented in projects I've worked on in the past. In addition, they set an order for how things should be developed in a more sensible way.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being a good team member is largely defined by two parts, willingness to work with others, and effective communication. Willingness to work with others is important in almost any work environment, as often you will not be working alone. Similarly, communication is important for both peers, and for asking questions of higher ups, such as project requirements.
